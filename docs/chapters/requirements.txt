Requirements
============


Minimum
=======

All deployment methods
----------------------

- RAM: 2 GB.
- CPU: dual core, 32 bit, 1 GHz, Intel Core 2 Duo or similar.
- Database manager: PostgreSQL 9.6.
- Platform: GNU/Linux distributions or operating systems that support mature
  virtualization and mature Docker with Docker Compose support.

.. note::

   Installation on devices with even lower specifications (like single
   board computer with ARM CPUs) is possible with below minimal performance
   and user experience expectations.

.. note::

   Due to the way container and virtualization technologies work, expected
   a performance penalty if these are used. For best results, use hardware
   that includes optimizations for virtualization and an operating system
   with native support for containers.

.. note::

   Docker implementations may vary depending on the host operating system.
   For best results use Docker on a well supported GNU/Linux distribution.


Direct deployment method
------------------------


- |DEFAULT_OS_DISTRIBUTION| GNU/Linux or a derivative distribution.
- Python version 3.7.


Recommended
===========


All sizes
---------

- RAM: 4 GB or more.
- CPU: 64 bit, 4 cores or more, 2 GHz or faster, third generation of the
  Intel Core processors (Core i7, i5, i3) "IvyBridge" or better.
- Storage: solid state drive.
- Database manager: PostgreSQL 12 or later.


Enterprise
----------

Each enterprise deployment is unique and there is no single requirement
recommendation or guidance that applies to all.
