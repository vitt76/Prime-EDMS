Docker is a container technology. Containers are a standard unit of software
that packages up code and all its dependencies.

Mayan EDMS uses Docker as its main distribution method.

By default, the entire software stack is deployed as a single container. This
provides an easy way to get started and will be sufficient for several
thousand documents.
