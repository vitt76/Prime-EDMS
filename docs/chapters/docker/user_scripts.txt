.. _docker_user_scripts:

======================
Executing user scripts
======================

It is possible to automate the execution of user code inside a container
every time it starts. This can take the form of a dash script or the path to
a script file.

This feature is controlled by two environment variables:

- ``MAYAN_DOCKER_SCRIPT_PRE_SETUP``

  Optional. Executed after the container's environment variables are
  configured but before the UID/GID setup, extra OS package installation
  and extra Python library installations. Executes the content as a script
  or call a script using the value as the filename.

- ``MAYAN_DOCKER_SCRIPT_POST_SETUP``

  Optional. Executed after the container's environment variables are
  configured, after the UID/GID setup, extra OS package installation
  and extra Python library installations but before launching the Mayan EDMS
  stack. Executes the content as a script or call a script using the value
  as the filename.

Examples:

As script content:

.. code-block:: console

   docker run \
   -d \
   --name mayan-edms \
   --restart=always \
   -p 80:8000 \
   ...
   -e MAYAN_DOCKER_SCRIPT_PRE_SETUP='echo "Pre setup command" >/tmp/pre_setup_output.txt'
   -v /docker-volumes/mayan-edms/media:/var/lib/mayan \
   mayanedms/mayanedms:|DOCKER_MAYAN_IMAGE_VERSION|


As a script file:

.. code-block:: console

   echo 'echo "Pre setup script" >/tmp/pre_setup_output.txt' > /docker-volumes/mayan-edms/media/script.sh

   docker run \
   -d \
   --name mayan-edms \
   --restart=always \
   -p 80:8000 \
   ...
   -e MAYAN_DOCKER_SCRIPT_PRE_SETUP=/var/lib/mayan/script.sh
   -v /docker-volumes/mayan-edms/media:/var/lib/mayan \
   mayanedms/mayanedms:|DOCKER_MAYAN_IMAGE_VERSION|


With Docker Compose, make the changes in the ``env_file`` using the same
format.

As script content:

.. code-block:: yaml

  MAYAN_DOCKER_SCRIPT_PRE_SETUP='echo "Pre setup command" >/tmp/pre_setup_output.txt'

As a script file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  MAYAN_DOCKER_SCRIPT_PRE_SETUP=/var/lib/mayan/script.sh
