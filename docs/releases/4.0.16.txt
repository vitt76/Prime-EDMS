Version 4.0.16
==============

Released: September 29, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------

Appearance
^^^^^^^^^^

An issue that caused menus to reset and collapse at random was fixed.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

On overload systems, document page image generation will reach the timeout
value as display the placeholder icon for invalid images. The setting
``CONVERTER_IMAGE_GENERATION_MAX_RETRIES`` was backported from version 4.1
to allow changing the maximum retry value of the image generation tasks from
a single location.

Celery's maximum retry value defaults to 3, which couple with the default
retry delay of 5 seconds means an image generation task will stop retrying
after 15 seconds. The new settings sets this values to a default of 7 for
estimated maximum retry time of 35 seconds per image.

Automatic quoting was added to the remaining migration query parameters to
ensure maximum compatibility with database managers.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OCR indexing examples in the documentation were updated according to the
document changes in version 4.0.

A new chapter was added outlining the step to create a development
deployment. The Docker image build chapter was updated to reference this new
chapter.

Instructions were added on how to use a PIP cache to speed up the Docker
image build process.

The current user is now capture and applied to the event when changing
the active version of a document.
