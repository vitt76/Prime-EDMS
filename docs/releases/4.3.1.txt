Version 4.3.1
=============

Released: August 21, 2022

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The impersonation app template caching was disabled. This ensures
the impersonation banner is triggered correctly in all edge cases where
multiple frontend processes or load balancers are used.


Cabinets
^^^^^^^^

An issue was fixed where documents uploaded via the wizard with one or
more cabinets selected, would not trigger the cabinet added event.


Settings
^^^^^^^^

The settings app templates caching was disabled. Just like the impersonation
app, this ensures correct functionality of the settings change
banner in all edge cases.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Permission filtering was added the source switch links. This change is only
visual and does not affect the functionality of the sources.

The permission filtering for the links is the same as the views: The
document create permission is required for the source links during document
uploads and the document file new permissions is required for the source
links in the new document file upload view.


Storage
^^^^^^^

The ``DownloadFile`` filename was being ignored when performing the actual
download action. The filename attribute is now used if available. If it is
not available or set, the fallback value is the string representation of
the download file object.


Tags
^^^^

Similar to the document upload cabinet event issue, a tag app issue was
fixed that allows now triggering the tag attached event for documents
with a tag selected during upload.


Task manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

More verbose errors and exceptions are now displayed to console when Celery
fails to initialize.


Testing
^^^^^^^

The make file targets for staging deployments were fixed and improved.
A local ``psql`` client is not longer required to monitor the launching
of the staging PostgreSQL container. Likewise a local Redis client is no
longer needed to launch the Redis container.


Other
^^^^^

- Added make file development targets ``setup-dev-operating-system-packages``
  and ``setup-dev-python-libraries``.
- Improve cabinet, metadata, and tag app tests.
