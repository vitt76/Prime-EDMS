Version 4.2.5
=============

Released: May 21, 2022

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

Fixed the asset transformations hash calculation. This fixes the issue
where uploading a new file for an asset already added via transformation
to a document page would not update the asset image in the document page.

Fixes a wrong parameter in the ``ImageDraw.Draw`` usage of the
``TransformationDrawRectangle`` transformation.

Added sanity check to reject negative zoom values for the
``TransformationZoom`` transformation.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated Django from version 3.2.12 to 3.2.13.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Fixed favorite document links reacting to favorite documents beyond the
active user.


REST API
^^^^^^^^

Fixed the asset image API view docstring. The docstring incorrectly displayed
"document" instead of "asset".


Search
^^^^^^

Converted the signal handler that triggers search indexing on many to many
fields changes to a background task. This solves an issue where the user
interface blocks when changing the document type to index template
association on large installations.

Updated the object index task to retry on missing object errors. There are
situations where the broker will route the message to the workers faster
than the database can commit the data, creating an false positive object
not found error.


Task manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added Celery queue deduplication to the ``CeleryQueue`` class. There are
no reported cases of duplicated queues but this will prevent possible issues.

Enabled app tests that were added but not enabled.

Added support for runtime removal of queues. This is not used by the core
system but is useful for third party apps wanting to remove queues defined
by the core apps.


User management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added a warning message when users attempt to delete their own accounts.


Other
^^^^^

- Remove unused authentication view.
- Remove unused event link.
- Make document version OCR submit view messages translatable.
- Make file caching purge view messages translatable.
- Make document file metadata submit view messages translatable.
- Fix repeated model manager definition in ``DocumentFilePage``
  models.
