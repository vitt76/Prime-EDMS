Version 4.1.3
=============

Released: November 2, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Appearance
^^^^^^^^^^

The copying of the bootstrap alert style was fixed. Alert styles now change
when the theme changes.

The copying of the bootstrap alert style was optimized by executing it only
in the root template. This runs the code just once instead of running it
on each page refresh. The element ``#div-javascript-dynamic-content`` was
also removed and it is now created and destroyed dynamically once just.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

An asset duplication bug in the percent coordinate transformation was fixed.

The ``cache_hash`` method of the ``Transformation`` class was split to
allow subclasses to modify how the cache hash is calculated.

The asset transformations now include the image hash as part of the
transformation hash calculation. This change allows automatic invalidation
of all cached document images that use an asset if the asset image is
modified.

The way the absolute coordinates of the percentage asset paste transformation
were calculated has been updated to more closely reflect the purpose of the
transformation. Minimum (0) or maximum (100) coordinate values does not cause
the asset to clip outside of the image borders anymore.


Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^

The order in which link conditional display functions are evaluated was
updated to ensure that the ``resolved_object`` variable is injected into
the context before passing the context to the link's ``check_condition``
function. While not reproduced, this code path was suspected to cause a user
interface issue with navigation links for a group of users.


Platform
^^^^^^^^

The Sentry client backend received some updates to increase its usefulness.
More SDK options were added. Sentry options are now typecasted from Mayan
settings to ensure proper data types.

Celery and Redis instrumentation integration was added to the Sentry client
backend.

The default value of ``traces_sample_rate`` option was lowered from 1 to
0.25. This value is better suited for production deployments. Increase to 1
for full debug information capture during development or testing.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Several staging folder source fixes and patches were merged. Staging
folders now use ``StreamingHttpResponse`` to serve previews bringing image
processing to the same level as the rest of the code. Code optimizations and
simplification were also merged which include better image cache
utilization and removal of a potential file descriptor leak.

Staging folders can now generate previews for office document files.

The source backend base class now does not assume all source backends provide
an upload form. This expands the usability of the new source backend system
introduced in version 4.1 to more stylwe of document sources.

A bug that prevented the SANE scanner source backend to work properly was
fixed. The error handling of the SANE scanner source was also improved.

Error logging of non interactive sources was also fixed.


Vagrant
^^^^^^^

The development Vagrant setup was improved. The virtual machine deployment
script now loads all values from the root ``config.env`` file. This ensures
that the virtual machine is generated using the same libraries,
dependencies and paths as the Docker image.

The version of the ``Supervisord`` program is now updated automatically.

The way APT and PIP proxies are configured was updated to match how they
are processed in the rest of the code base. This allows a single proxy
configuration to work with all build methods.

A makefile was added to aid in working with the Vagrant setup.


Other
^^^^^

- The devpi targets were moved to the main makefile to allow them to be used
  by all the build methods.
