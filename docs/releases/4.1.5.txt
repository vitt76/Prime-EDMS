Version 4.1.5
=============

Released: February 4, 2022

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Logging
^^^^^^^

Error log entries are now created for objects that existed before the last
error log changes. This fixes the
``ErrorLogPartition matching query does not exist`` issue.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Fixed email sources processing a single message but performing cleanup on
multiple messages. The intended behavior is restored which is to processed
one message and clean up the processed message only.

Context managers are now used for the IMAP and POP3 sources to perform
automatic cleanup and remove the possibility of orphaned descriptors. This
update also fixed the reference to ``shared_uploaded_files`` before the
variable being available.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

The workflow template now exposes the ``auto_launch`` field via the REST API.

The ``EmailAction`` subclass was added for backwards compatibility with
existing email workflow state actions.
