^^^^^

- Merge improvements from version 4.1.6.

  - Append the text "signed" to the label of a signed document file instead

    Solves issue in forum post 6149. Thanks to forum user @qra for the report
    and debug information.
  - Update IMAP source ``store commands`` to be optional.
  - Update email sources ``SSL`` checkbox to be optional.
  - Undo POP3 source context manager changes from commit
    c19040491e20c9a783ae6191613bc8c5f7acb038. It seems Python's email libraries
    do not have feature parity. ``imaplib`` was updated to support context
    managers but ``poplib`` was not.

- Renaming of the ``mimetype`` app to ``mime_types``.
- Removal of the ``.api.get_mimetype`` function. The process now requires

  ``get_mime_type`` method:

  .. code-block:: python

    from mayan.apps.mime_types.classes import MIMETypeBackend
    MIMETypeBackend.get_backend_instance().get_mime_type(...)

- Search model names are now specified in lower case in the user interface
  URL or in the search API URL.
