Version 4.2.2
=============

Released: March 21, 2022

Status: Stable

Changes
-------

Emailing
^^^^^^^^

Migrate old workflow ``EmailAction`` instances instead of sub-classing
for backwards compatibility. Using the official workflow migration
functionality avoids a double entry in the workflow state action selection
dropdown list.


Messaging
^^^^^^^^^

Filter unread message count badge by message read permission.


Metadata
^^^^^^^^

Update document metadata model field label from "Metadata type value"
to "Metadata value".


Sources
^^^^^^^

Ensure new document and file links access works like their respective
views. The links will be active when the access is granted for the source
as well as the document/document type.


Other
^^^^^

- Ensure the object copy permission is required for the object copy link.
- Fix document file signature serializer label.
