Version 4.2.8
=============

Released: July 22, 2022

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


CD/CI
^^^^^

The GitLab CI file was updated to support releasing testing builds of the
Python library and the Docker image separately. The new GitOps branches
are ``releases/testing_docker`` and ``releases/testing_python``. The
existing GitOps branch of ``releases/testing`` is preserved and continues to
behave as usual.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following Python dependencies were updated:

- Django from version 3.2.13 to 3.2.14
- Pillow from version 8.3.1 to 8.3.2.
- cryptodome from version 3.10.1 to 3.10.4.
- PyPDF2 from version 1.26.0 to 1.28.4.
- Sphinx from version 3.5.4 to 4.5.0.

The Docker Debian base image was updated from ``debian:11.3-slim`` to to
``debian:11.4-slim``.

The package ``firefox-geckdriver`` was removed from the make file target
``setup-dev-environment`` as it is no longer available in recent OS LTS
releases.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Fixed the permission requirement of the recently created documents dashboard
widget. The widget should filter by document view and not document type
view permission.
