Version 4.0.13
==============

Released: August 2, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Cabinets
^^^^^^^^

The document cabinet list link was updated to require the same permission
scheme as the view it references.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

The document creation date time was enabled as a search field. The format of
the date and time search field follows the scheme
``year-month-day hour:minute:seconds``.


Indexing
^^^^^^^^

The document index instance list link was updated to require the same
permission scheme as the view it references.


OCR
^^^

The OCR submit GUI and API views now track correctly the user initiating the
action when committing the event.

The text of the OCR events was fixed.


Organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The organization URL and host settings were improved. Django's ``HttpRequest``
is now patched to make it easier to override the scheme and host of the
installation.

The organization setting used to set the REST API URL base path was fixed.
API endpoints that generate an URL now take into account the setting.
