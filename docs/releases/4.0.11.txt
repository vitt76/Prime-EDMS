Version 4.0.11
==============

Released: July 07, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


API
^^^

The ``id`` field was added as a sortable field to all the API endpoints that
have ordering enabled.


Docker
^^^^^^

The ``wait.sh`` file was replaced with a Python alternative that can wait on
network ports or PostgreSQL directly as a client.

``supervisord`` was upgraded from Debian buster version 3.3.5-1 to Debian
bullseye version 4.2.2-2. This version uses Python3 and was the last
dependency that required installing Python2 in the Docker image.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Switch deployment instructions to use ``venv`` instead of ``virtualenv``.
The direct deployment and the Docker image now use the same Python
virtual environment alternative.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Updated the date time copy code from migration document:0063 to work with
databases that store time zone information and those that don't.


GitLab CI
^^^^^^^^^

Added support for using local or external PIP caches to build Docker images.

The GitLab CI upgrade tests now update a test document to populate the older
version install and trigger more migration code paths.


Platform
^^^^^^^^

Updated all shell usage from ``bash`` to ``sh``. ``sh`` symlinks to ``dash``
in the Docker image. This also expands the usability of the supervisor
file for direct deployments in more operating systems.

Improved the way the ``user_settings_folder`` variable was created. It now
works correctly with ``MEDIA_ROOT`` paths that contain a trailing slash and
those that don't.


Other
