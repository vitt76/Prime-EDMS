Version 4.0.9
=============

Released: June 29, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Search
^^^^^^

With the feedback of the community some fixes and improvements were made to
the scoped search feature. It is now possible to aggregate more than two
scopes using a single operator. Support for specifying the ``match_all``
logic per scope was also added. The ability to return a single scope without
rewriting the entire search query was also improved.

To ensure correct query results, search limits are now automatically
disabled per scope when performing a multi scope search, but still enforced
for the final result.

The scope decoding code was partially rewritten for clarity and to allow
the current and future improvements.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The padding of the main menu panel anchors was increased while the padding
of the list items was removed. This allows the entire height of the menu
item to react to click events.

The main menu accordion indicator when will now rotate when a menu is opened
or closed.

The jQuery usage of the $(this) object was improved. Also some unused jQuery
code from the document card update methods was removed. This two changes
lower the browser memory usage when many document cards are displayed and
speed up the initial display during a page load.


Other
^^^^^

- More uses of the ``update_fields`` argument were to added to ``.save()``
  methods.
- Simplify logic using the document parser content update using
  ``update_or_create``.
- Raise document list errors on debug or testing.
