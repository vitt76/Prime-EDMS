Version 4.0.17
==============

Released: October 18, 2021

Status: Maintenance

Changes
--------


Appearance
^^^^^^^^^^

A new icon driver was added to support stacked Font Awesome icons.


Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The usage ``.user.has_usable_password`` was fixed. This solves the
"Change Password" link not being disabled when using external authentication.


Common
^^^^^^

Support was added for ``COMMON_EXTRA_APPS_PRE``. This setting works like
``COMMON_EXTRA_APPS`` but installs the new apps before the default
apps. This allows the extra apps to override templates and other system
data.

Support for blank/empty app URL namespaces was added. These are used to
register the ``urlpatterns`` of encapsulated libraries as top level named
URLs.

The ``user_settings`` folder is now created and initialized on upgrades too.

The error handling logic of the initial folder creation was improved.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

Asset image cache creation was fixed. Allows using assets for decorations
in all cases.


Docker
^^^^^^

The ``MAYAN_GUNICORN_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY`` environment variable is now
exported and available to ``supervisord`` in all cases.

The owner of the ``/var/lib/mayan/`` is now always changed on container
startup. This ensures that the ``mayan`` operating system user can always
read and write from and to the mounted volume.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

The migration from version 3.5.x to 4.0.x was improved to ensure only one
document version per document is active after the migration.


Organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The help texts of the ``ORGANIZATIONS_INSTALLATION_URL`` and
``ORGANIZATIONS_URL_BASE_PATH`` settings were expanded to better explain
their functions.


REST API
^^^^^^^^

A workaround for a ``swagger-spec-validator`` dependency bug was backported
from version 4.1. The library ``jsonschema`` is now pinned to version 3.2.0
to avoid errors with ``swagger-spec-validator`` 2.7.3.
``swagger-spec-validator`` does not specify a version for ``jsonschema``
(https://github.com/Yelp/swagger_spec_validator/blob/master/setup.py#L17),
which installs the latest version of ``jsonschema``, 4.0.1. This version
removes ``jsonschema.compat`` still used by ``swagger-spec-validator``.


Other
^^^^^

- Add ``project_url`` attribute to the Python setup file.
- Move the filesystem ``touch`` function to the storages app.
- Add Redis restart step to the upgrade instructions.
