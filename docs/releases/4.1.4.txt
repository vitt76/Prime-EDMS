Version 4.1.4
=============

Released: December 1, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Appearance
^^^^^^^^^^

An issue that caused the closing of the responsive menu to trigger the
home view navigation was fixed.

Some JavaScript optimizations were added:

- Cache argument length when in ``.fn.hasAnyClass``.
- Configure fancybox just once.
- Set converter image functions as ``async``.
- Remove jQuery's ``one`` usage.


Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

``libjpeg`` and ``libpng`` were added to the development setup makefile
target.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

An issue with the image generation of the document version first page
thumbnail that caused the thumbnail dimensions to be ignored was fixed.


Error logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The resource locking was removed from the error logging. This fixes the
random lock error message when using watch folders running from multiple
workers.

The error logging instances are now created when the underlying model
instance is also created. This removed the need for the resource locking.

The ``ErrorLog`` model was renamed to ``StoredErrorLog``. This change follows
the normal paradigm when a service is provided by a model and a runtime class.

The ``name`` field of the ``StoredErrorLog`` model was updated to be unique.
This ensures that ``get_or_create`` works in an atomic way when creating
the ``StoredErrorLog`` instance.

When a model instance is deleted, its error log partition is now deleted too,
instead of just deleting the error log partition entries.


REST API
^^^^^^^^

Added the ``AutoHelpTextLabelFieldMixin`` class. This mixin tries to extract
the label and help text from the model field when the serializer field does
not specify any.

Filtering was added to the ``parent`` field of the index template node
serializers. This restricts options to the current index template and allows
removing the now redundant validation.

The field ``index_template_root_node_id`` was added to the index template
serializer.


Testing
^^^^^^^

A memory database is now used when running the tests.


Other
^^^^^

- Fix the ``AdvancedSearchViewTestCaseMixin`` class. It had
  ``GenericViewTestCase`` as a base class when it is supposed to be a mixin
  and not have any.
- Changes merged from versions 4.0.20 and 4.0.21.

  - Perform more strict cleanup of test models.
  - Clean up the test model app config cache after the test
    end not before the test model is created.
  - Improve lock manager test cases.
  - Add standalone Celery beat container.
