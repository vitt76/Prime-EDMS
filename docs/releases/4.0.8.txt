Version 4.0.8
=============

Released: June 23, 2021

Status: Stable


Changes
-------


Background tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The queue distribution was tuned again to continue improving throughput and
efficiency of the workers. Message consumption rate was increased for the
``indexing``, ``search``, ``uploads``, ``duplicates``, ``file metadata`` and
``metadata`` queues.

The readability Celery worker options was improved by using the long version
of the options.


Docker
^^^^^^

The Docker base image was updated from Debian:10.8-slim to Debian:10.10-slim.

The example RabbitMQ container entry in the Docker Compose file was updated
to include the entries necessary to enable the image with the management
plugin.

A new chapter was added explaining document files. The document version
chapter was updated to include the changes since version 4.0.


Document parsing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The document parsing submit actions were updated to keep track of the user and
apply it to the events when committed.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

The document file and version page image API were optimized by reusing the
page object per request.

The date and time of document version timestamps are now carried over
during the upgrade from version 3.5.x to 4.0.x.

Fixed the situation where the document type button was not appearing. The
cascade condition of the document type setup link was updated to correctly
display when there are not document types created.


Digital signatures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The preparation of the GPG temporary home folder was improved. A temporary
directory context manager is now used which also guarantees that the
temporary folder will be removed even on failures.

The document signature logic was updated to not assume that all signatures
provide a ``date_time`` field.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

PIP was updated to version 21.1.2 and Django was updated from version 2.2.23
to 2.2.24.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Docker Compose installation and upgrade instructions we improved.
PostgreSQL migration instructions were also added.


Emailing
^^^^^^^^

The document email attachment was updated to send the active version instead
of the last file uploaded. The email action will now export the active
version and email that as an attachments. This mimics more closely the
existing behavior of this feature before the document version were separated
into versions and files.


File metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The file metadata submit actions were updated to keep track of the user and
apply it to the events committed.


Metadata
^^^^^^^^

Fixed an issue with the document metadata add and edit actions which
caused the user value to be ignored at the event commit.


Platform
^^^^^^^^

The direct deployment and Docker supervisord templates were unified. The
direct deployment and the Docker image now use the same supervisord
template.

The GitLab CI configuration files and the Dockerfile were converted into
templates. This allows these to use the same settings and Docker image
tags as the rest of the project without requiring manual updates.


Testing
^^^^^^^

Event testing was improved for several apps. Events testing is now performed
in an unified manner using the provided ``._clear_events()`` and
``.get_test_events()``. This supercedes the imporing the ``Action`` model
directly.


Other
^^^^^

- Make optional the `user_id` argument of
  `task_document_file_page_image_generate`.
- Don't cache the missing items template to allow it to be removed when
  the missing items are fixed.
- Apply small optimization to ``MultipleObjectViewMixin``
  ``.get_object_list()`` method. The method now reuses the existing
  ``pk_list`` variable.
- Add serializer explicit read only fields.
- Optimize documents app saves with `update_fields`.
