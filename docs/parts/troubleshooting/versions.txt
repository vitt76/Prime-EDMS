.. _troubleshooting-version-4.0:

After upgrade to version 4.0
============================

Error: ``...CachePartitionFile.DoesNotExist: CachePartitionFile matching query does not exist.``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The document storage layout changed in version 4.0. The following settings
were changed as a result:

- ``DOCUMENTS_CACHE_STORAGE_BACKEND`` became ``DOCUMENTS_FILE_PAGE_IMAGE_CACHE_STORAGE_BACKEND``
- ``DOCUMENTS_CACHE_STORAGE_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS`` became ``DOCUMENTS_FILE_PAGE_IMAGE_CACHE_STORAGE_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS``
- ``DOCUMENTS_STORAGE_BACKEND`` became ``DOCUMENTS_FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND``
- ``DOCUMENTS_STORAGE_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS`` became ``DOCUMENTS_FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS``

During the upgrade, the values of these settings will be migrated. Due to the
many ways Mayan EDMS can be deployed and configured, this automatic migration
might not succeed in all cases. The result is that after the upgrade, Mayan
EDMS will be looking for the document files and cached document file images
in the wrong place.

To solve this, migrate the setting values by hand or rename the folder
``document_storage`` to ``document_file_storage``. Then perform a restart.


Error: ``FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/lib/mayan/document_file_storage/...``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Same solution as with error: ``...CachePartitionFile.DoesNotExist: CachePartitionFile matching query does not exist.``


.. _troubleshooting-version-4.1:

After upgrade to version 4.1
============================

Existing indexes are missing
----------------------------

Due to the changes in the index tree generation algorithm and database
integrity configuration, existing index trees will deleted during upgrade
and need to be rebuild after upgrade.

Supervisord error using direct deployment
-----------------------------------------


.. code-block:: console

    Error: Format string '%(ENV_MAYAN_GUNICORN_BIN)s --workers%(ENV_MAYAN_GUNICORN_WORKERS)s ...' for 'program:mayan-edms-gunicorn.command' contains names ('ENV_MAYAN_GUNICORN_BIN') which cannot be expanded. Available names: ... in section 'program:mayan-edms-gunicorn' (file: '/etc/supervisor/conf.d/mayan-edms.conf')

This is a bug with Supervisord fixed in version 4.2.2:

    "Fixed a bug where environment variables defined in environment= in the [supervisord] section or a [program:x] section could not be used in %(ENV_x)s expansions. Patch by MythRen."

    http://supervisord.org/changes.html

To solve this upgrade Supervisord to version 4.2.2.

For Debian and Ubuntu:

Install the ``supervisor_4.2.2-2_all.deb`` package from Debian
"bullseye": https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/supervisor
