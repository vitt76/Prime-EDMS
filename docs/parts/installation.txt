Installation methods
====================

Docker
------

Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level
virtualization also known as containerization. It allows independent
"containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead
of starting and maintaining virtual machines (VMs).

Docker Compose
--------------
Docker Compose is a Docker plugin for defining and orchestrating Docker
applications spanning multiple containers.


.. note::

   This is the installation method recommended for the majority of cases.


- :ref:`docker_compose_install`

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    ../chapters/docker/install_docker_compose


Kubernetes
----------

For enterprise installations.


.. important::

    This installation method requires deeper Docker knowledge and requires
    additional software products like load balancers, object storage,
    container registries, monitoring, among others.

    Each enterprise deployment is unique and there is no single
    recommendation or guidance that applies to all. For this reason
    information on scaling up is not provided as it alone would be the topic
    for an entire book.

    If you or your organization needs to scale Mayan EDMS beyond what is
    possible with a default installation, commercial services are available
    and performed by members of the core team.

    We have helped hundreds of companies scale up Mayan EDMS to host millions
    of documents with unlimited growth potential as well as creating high
    availability and fault tolerant deployments.

    We would love to meet you and your team to have a discussion. For more
